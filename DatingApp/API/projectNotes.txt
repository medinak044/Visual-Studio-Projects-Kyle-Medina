In the ExtendedUserEntity migration file, make sure to set "nullable:" field to true:
-Interests
-Introduction
-LookingFor
-PublicId (under "Photos")

After registering new users, manually insert values into NULL fields because
somewhere, I made a code mistake where api won't accept retreiving null fields from database (sqlite)
^- Made a quick fix on "register.component.ts" and "RegisterDto.cs" where registered user object will have " " values in the nullable fields (ex. interests, introduction, lookingFor)
